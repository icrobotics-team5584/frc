# WebJCC

The Web Jetson Camera Client
*The WebJCC is designed as a solution for the FRC Team 5584's robot, where an intermittent camera stream had to be viewed over the network without access to any additional data.*

This software will also work on any other MJPEG stream, just dial in the IP, Port, Path, and whether you want the stream to keep polling for it to pick back up in the event of a failure.

Staged application can be found at https://mitchellblaser.github.io/WebJCC/.
